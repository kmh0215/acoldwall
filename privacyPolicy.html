        <p>
            Your privacy is of great importance to us and we handle and protect your
            data accordingly. Below, we have outlined all the ways we use your information and
            why it is necessary to do so. We value your security as much as we value your custom
            and are fully committed to preserving your privacy.
        </p>

                <strong>How your information is unused</strong>
                <p>
                    The details you provide to us are used in several ways - some not as obvious as others.
                    We have separated each specific detail you supply to us and the ways in which they

                <p>
                    We will ask for your name, phone number and e-mail address for a multitude of
                    reasons. This information allows us to:
                    <br>
                    Ensure delivery of purchase is directed to the right person.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Keep you up to date on new products, services and projects via e-mail. We will only

                <p>
                    Your gender is relevant because it allows us to:

                    Efficiently direct you to the correct part of our website (menswear/womenswear).

                <p>
                    This information is collected during payment transactions. It allows us to:

                    <br>
                    Process orders once items are added to basket.
                    <br>

                <strong>INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DEVICE AND HOW YOU USE OUR WEBSITE</strong>
                <p>
                    When you use our website, your IP address and device type are noted. This information
                    is useful to us because it allows us to:
                    <br>
                    Set default options specific to you (such as language, currency and item availability).
                    <br>
                    Detect and prevent fraud enacted against either yourself or A-COLD-WALL*.
                    <br>
                    Sharing your information
                    <br>
                    Our relationship with our customers is paramount. That you have entrusted us with
                    your information and support what we do at A-COLD-WALL* instils in us a duty to be
                    transparent with how we use your data. We will never sell any of your personal data to
                    third parties. This includes your name, address, e-mail address and credit card
                    information.
                    <br>
                    There are, however, instances whereby your data is crucial to providing a good
                    standard of customer service and improving the experience of all involved - namely,
                    yourself and A-COLD-WALL*. We may share your information with:
                    <br>
                    Payment service providers, order packers, warehouses and delivery companies.
                    These are the companies that deal with the delivery of your goods. Certain information
                    (name, address etc.) is necessary to share in order to get your items to you.
                    <br>
                    Marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts. These professional service
                    providers help with the business side of A-COLD-WALL*.
                    <br>
                    Credit reference agencies, law enforcement ad fraud prevention agencies. These are
                    the entities that prevent and tackle fraud.
                    <br>
                    We may share anonymous information with third parties but this is for the purposes of
                    analytics and figures. We make sure none of this data can be used to identify you.
                    <br>
                    Marketing messages
                    <br>
                    If you allow us to, we will keep you updated on A-COLD-WALL* products and news via
                    e-mail or text. This service ensures you are kept aware of the latest projects at
                    A-COLD-WALL*.
                    <br>
                    You can put a stop to marketing updates from A-COLD-WALL* at any time by:
                    <br>
                    Clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any e-mail from us.
                    <br>
                    Contacting our customer service team at data-protection@a-cold-wall.com.
                    <br>
                    If you opt-out of marketing messages through any of the above methods, we will
                    ensure your settings are updated with immediate effect. However, due to the complex
                    nature of our services and the volume of messages we receive, the update may take a
                    few days to complete. This means that you may receive a few more marketing updates
                    as we process the change to your account. Please allow some time for the changes to
                    take effect before contacting us again.
                    <br>
                    Preventing marketing messages will not stop vital service communications - order
                    updates etc.

                    Online advertising

                    ad exchanges to target A-COLD-WALL* banners and advertisements to you when you
                    are browsing other websites or apps. Ad technologies used include: cookies

                    Your information outside the EU
                    <br>
                    Some of the important services we use have their servers located in the USA. Although
                    the USA is not bound by European Commissionâ€™s standard data protection clauses, we
                    protect your privacy and your rights by implementing the European Commissionâ€™s
                    standard data protection clauses.

                    Holding onto your data
                    <br>
                    We can only retain your information while you are an A-COLD-WALL* customer. You
                    are within your rights to request us to delete all of your personal data we have stored.
                    Contact our customer service team at data-protection@a-cold-wall.com in order to do
                    so.
                    <br>
                    There may be circumstances in which we keep hold of some of your information, even
                    after you close youâ€™re A-COLD-WALL* account or it is no longer required to provide
                    specific services to you. These include: prevention of fraud and abuse; enforcement of
                    our Terms & Conditions; solving disputes; or other such legal of regulatory
                    requirements.
