                <strong>INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DEVICE AND HOW YOU USE OUR WEBSITE</strong>

                    When you use our website, your IP address and device type are noted. This information
                    is useful to us because it allows us to:
                    <br>
                    Set default options specific to you (such as language, currency and item availability).

                    Detect and prevent fraud enacted against either yourself or A-COLD-WALL*.
                    <br>
                    Sharing your information
                    <br>
                    Our relationship with our customers is paramount. That you have entrusted us with
                    your information and support what we do at A-COLD-WALL* instils in us a duty to be
                    transparent with how we use your data. We will never sell any of your personal data to
                    third parties. This includes your name, address, e-mail address and credit card
                    information.
                    <br>
                    There are, however, instances whereby your data is crucial to providing a good
                    standard of customer service and improving the experience of all involved - namely,
                    yourself and A-COLD-WALL*. We may share your information with:
                    <br>
                    Payment service providers, order packers, warehouses and delivery companies.
                    These are the companies that deal with the delivery of your goods. Certain information
                    (name, address etc.) is necessary to share in order to get your items to you.
                    <br>
                    Marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts. These professional service
                    providers help with the business side of A-COLD-WALL*.
                    <br>
                    Credit reference agencies, law enforcement ad fraud prevention agencies. These are
                    the entities that prevent and tackle fraud.
                    <br>
                    We may share anonymous information with third parties but this is for the purposes of
                    analytics and figures. We make sure none of this data can be used to identify you.
                    <br>
                    Marketing messages
                    <br>
                    If you allow us to, we will keep you updated on A-COLD-WALL* products and news via
                    e-mail or text. This service ensures you are kept aware of the latest projects at
                    A-COLD-WALL*.
                    <br>
                    You can put a stop to marketing updates from A-COLD-WALL* at any time by:
                    <br>
                    Clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any e-mail from us.
                    <br>
                    Contacting our customer service team at data-protection@a-cold-wall.com.
                    <br>
                    If you opt-out of marketing messages through any of the above methods, we will
                    ensure your settings are updated with immediate effect. However, due to the complex
                    nature of our services and the volume of messages we receive, the update may take a
                    few days to complete. This means that you may receive a few more marketing updates
                    as we process the change to your account. Please allow some time for the changes to
                    take effect before contacting us again.
                    <br>
                    Preventing marketing messages will not stop vital service communications - order
                    updates etc.
