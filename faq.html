                        ACW now ships to Europe and the United States using DDP (Delivery Duty Paid).

                        For all other regions, if customers refuse to accept delivery of the parcel,
                        they are still liable for both shipment and customs charges.

                    <p>
                        We aim to process and ship all orders within 1-2 business days of purchase.
                        This time is subject to change due to the nature of production and
                        heavy order volumes.

                    <p>
                        Once an order has been completed, we unfortunately cannot change
                        the shipping address. Exceptions can be made in the event of
                        a simple spelling error, if this is the case, please contact customer support
                        as quickly as possible and state clearly the changes that need to be made.

                        Unfortunately, it is not possible to choose a specific date and time via
                        the A-COLD-WALL* website. If a change of date is needed,
                        please contact the courier specific to your location directly
                        to establish if this is possible.
