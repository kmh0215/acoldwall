        <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to 
            achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to 
            access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources
            (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this 
            Application.
        </p>
        <p>
            For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this 
            document - unless there is a reason to differentiate.
            For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers,
            it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they
            are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term
            Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular
            type of Tracker.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the
            User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time
            following the instructions provided in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner
            (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a
            third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within
            this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.
            The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary
            depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them
            expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.
            In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories
            below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime
            specification as well as any other relevant information - such as the presence of
            other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party
            providers or by contacting the Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this Application and delivery of
            the Service
        </p>
        <p>
            This Application uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to
            carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the
            Service.

        <strong>Tag Management</strong>
        <p>
            This type of service helps the Owner to manage the tags or scripts needed on this
            Application in a centralised fashion.
            This results in the Users' Data flowing through these services, potentially resulting
            in the retention of this Data.
        </p>

        <strong>Google Tag Manager</strong>
        <p>
            Google Tag Manager is a tag management service provided by Google LLC or by
            Google Ireland Limited, depending on how the Owner manages the Data processing.

        <p>Platform services and hosting</p>
        <p>
            These services have the purpose of hosting and running key components of this
            Application, therefore allowing the provision of this Application from within a
            unified platform. Such platforms provide a wide range of tools to the
            Owner - e.g. analytics, user registration, commenting, database management,
            e-commerce, payment processing - that imply the collection and handling
            of Personal Data.
            Some of these services work through geographically distributed servers, making
            it difficult to determine the actual location where the Personal Data are stored.
        </p>

        <strong>Shopify</strong>
        <p>
            Shopify is a platform provided by Shopify Inc. that allows the Owner to build,

        </span>
        <span>
            Some of the advertising services used by the Owner adhere to the 
            IAB Transparency and Consent Framework, an initiative that facilitates responsible 
            privacy practises across the digital advertising industry - providing Users with 
            enhanced transparency and control over how their data are used for advertising 
            tracking purposes. Users can customise their advertising preferences at any time 
            by accessing the advertising preferences panel from within the cookie notice 
            or via the relevant link on this Application.
        </span>
        <span>
            This Application participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework

        <strong>How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</strong>
        <span>
            There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and 
            withdraw consent, where relevant:
        </span>
        <span>
            Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their 
            own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.
        </span>
        <span>
            Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide 
            or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or 
            by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences 
            widget, if available.
        </span>
        <span>
            It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously 
            stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User’s initial consent.
        </span>
        <span>
            Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the 
            browsing history.
        </span>
        <span>
            With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and 
            withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the 
            means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.
        </span>

        <strong>Locating Tracker Settings</strong>
        <span>
            Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most 
            commonly used browsers at the following addresses:
        </span>
        <span>Google Chrome</span>
        <span>Mozilla Firefox</span>
        <span>Apple Safari</span>
        <span>Microsoft Internet Explorer</span>
        <span>Microsoft Edge</span>
        <span>Brave</span>
        <span>Opera</span>
        <span>
            Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by 
            opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings 
            for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device 
            settings and look for the relevant setting).
        </span>
        
        <strong> How to opt out of interest-based advertising</strong>
        <span>
            Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by 
            YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the 
            Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or 
            other similar services. Such initiatives allow Users to select their tracking 
            preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that 
            Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this 
            document.
        </span>
        <span>
            The Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices that helps 
            Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.
        </span>
            
        
        <strong>Consequences of denying consent</strong>
        <span>
            Users are free to decide whether or not to grant consent. However, please note 
            that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced 
            functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document). 
            Therefore, in the absence of the User's consent, the Owner may be unable to 
            provide related features.
